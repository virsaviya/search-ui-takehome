## Search UI

This is a take home for a front end position building a simple keyword based search filter.

#### Requirements
- The ​data viewer​, which display the sentences. Each dark blue box
represents one sentence
- The ​search bar​ where users can type in the keyword they’re looking for
We want to display the sentences that contain the word the user typed in, as shown below
- We want the list of sentences to update ​as the user types in the word.​ Example shown below - as the user types in the word “video”, sentences that don’t match disappear.

#### Installation

to get started
```
  got clone git@github.com:virsaviya/search-ui-takehome.git
  cd search-ui-takehome
  yarn install
  yarn start
```
then navigate to http://localhost:3000/

#### Notes
I used the [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) library to build the search, as a library is going to be far more thorough.
